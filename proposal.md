## Research questions

Possible research questions that can be answered by this visualization are as follows:

1.  What was the progression of each drag queen on each season?

2.  Which drag queen has the highest win right across all seasons?

3.  Who was the youngest drag queen on any season?

4.  Which drag queens came from each state?

## Usage scenario

James is a frequent watcher of RuPaul's Drag Race. He has seen every season of the American franchise however, he struggles to remember all the drag queens, and how they did, and each season with the sheer volume of seasons at this point.

With the increasing popularity of the show, more queens have started to go on tour. However, James does not have the money to go see every drag queen that comes to town. He would like a tool to figure out how each queen performs in their season, and overall compared to all the queens in each season. The visualization app dragracer_viz can help James with his problem. This app can get the overall performance of each drag queen on a season or overall on the franchise. He can also figure out how old each queen was when they were on their season and where their hometown is located. Finally, he can get information on special categories like `winners`, `finalists`, `first eliminated` and `miss congeniality`.

Following this, James can make an informed decision on which drag queen he would like to spend his money to go see when they come to town.
